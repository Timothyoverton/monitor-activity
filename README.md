# Angular Web Stub

This is a boilerplate Angular project designed for quick deployment to GitHub Pages. It includes all the necessary configuration for automated deployment via GitHub Actions.

## Quick Start for New Projects

To use this as a template for a new project:

1. **Clone this repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Timothyoverton/angular-web-stub.git your-new-project
   cd your-new-project
   ```

2. **Update the project name and GitHub Pages path**:
   - In `package.json`: Update `"name"` field and replace `/angular-web-stub/` with `/your-new-project/` in the `build:prod` and `deploy` scripts
   - In `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: Update `publish_dir` if needed (usually stays the same)
   - In this README: Update the repo URLs and project name

3. **Set up the new GitHub repository**:
   ```bash
   git remote remove origin
   git remote add origin https://github.com/Timothyoverton/your-new-project.git
   git branch -M main
   ```

4. **Install dependencies and test locally**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

5. **Push to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   - Go to your GitHub repo â†’ Settings â†’ Pages
   - Source: "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: "gh-pages" / "(root)"

## Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Start development server at http://localhost:4200/
- `npm run build` - Build for development
- `npm run build:prod` - Build for production with correct base href
- `npm test` - Run unit tests
- `npm run deploy` - Build and deploy to GitHub Pages manually

## Deployment

The project is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages:

1. **Automatic**: Push to `main` branch triggers GitHub Actions workflow that builds and deploys
2. **Manual**: Run `npm run deploy` (requires `angular-cli-ghpages` package)

## Key Configuration Files

- `package.json` - Contains deployment scripts with correct base href
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow for auto-deployment
- `angular.json` - Angular CLI configuration
- `src/app/app.html` - Main component template (currently shows "Can you see me?")

## Important Notes for Claude Code

When creating new projects from this stub:

1. **Always update the base href** in `package.json` scripts to match the new repo name
2. **The GitHub Pages URL** will be: `https://timothyoverton.github.io/your-repo-name/`
3. **GitHub Actions** automatically deploys on push to main branch
4. **No manual gh-pages setup needed** - the workflow handles everything
5. **Test locally first** with `npm start` before pushing

## Project Structure

This is a standard Angular project with:
- Angular 20+ (latest version)
- Standalone components (no NgModules)
- TypeScript 5.8+
- Simple responsive design
- Ready for immediate deployment

## Troubleshooting

- If GitHub Pages shows 404: Check that base href matches your repo name
- If build fails: Ensure Node.js version 20+ is being used
- If styles don't load: Verify the base href in production build
- If deployment fails: Check GitHub Actions logs and ensure GitHub Pages is enabled
